Myko is a lightweight open-source terminal workspace (ADE) built on Tauri 2 + Rust and React 19. Featuring a native PTY backend with a WebGL renderer, an agentic AI side-panel that runs against your own keys or fully local models, plus a code editor, file explorer, source control with a git graph, and a web preview pane built in. About 7-8 MB on disk. No telemetry. No account.

## Features

### Terminal

- xterm.js with WebGL renderer, multi-tab with background streaming
- GPU-accelerated block-based terminal with editor-like command input
- Native PTY backend via `portable-pty` (zsh, bash, pwsh, fish, cmd)
- Split panels (horizontal and vertical)
- Inline search, link detection, true-color
- Per-tab workspace environments on Windows (Local, or any installed WSL distro)

### Code editor

- CodeMirror 6 (supports all popular languages - TS/JS, Rust, Python, Go, C/C++, Java, HTML/CSS, JSON, Markdown, etc.)
- Inline AI autocomplete with local model support
- AI edit diffs, accept or reject hunk by hunk
- Vim mode
- Ten built-in editor themes: Atom One, Aura, Copilot, GitHub Dark / Light, Gruvbox Dark, Nord, Tokyo Night, Xcode Dark / Light

### Source control

- Stage / unstage hunks, commit (Cmd+Enter / Ctrl+Enter), push with upstream awareness
- Branch display including detached HEAD state
- Git history pane with a real commit graph (lane rendering for merges and branches)
- Commit search and filter, click through to the remote commit page

### File explorer

- Catppuccin icon theme
- Fuzzy search, keyboard navigation, inline rename, context actions
- Attach files and selections directly to the AI side-panel

### Web preview

- Auto-detects local dev servers and opens them in a preview tab
- External URL preview via a native child webview

### Themes and customization

- Custom themes built in-app, switch between bundled presets and your own
- Create your own themes, share them or import from the community
- Background images with adjustable opacity and blur
- Editor theme is independent from the app theme

### AI

- **BYOK providers:** OpenAI, Anthropic, Google (Gemini), Groq, xAI (Grok), Cerebras, OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Mistral, plus any OpenAI-compatible endpoint
- **Local / offline:** LM Studio, MLX, Ollama
- **Agentic workflow:** plans, sub-agents, project memory via `MYKO.md`, file read / write / edit / multi-edit / grep / glob, bash with approval gating, background processes
- **Composer:** snippets via `#handle`, files via `@path`, slash commands, voice input, attach-to-agent from explorer or selection
- **Custom agents** with their own system prompt and tool subset
- **Plan mode** for multi-step work, generates and confirms before doing

## Install

Latest installers are available on the Releases page. Myko auto-updates from there.

### Windows notes

- On first launch Windows shows "Windows protected your PC" because the build is unsigned. Click **More info** then **Run anyway**.
- Default shell detection: `pwsh.exe` (PowerShell 7+) -> `powershell.exe` (Windows PowerShell 5.1) -> `cmd.exe`.
- WSL is a first-class workspace environment, not a wrapped subprocess.

### Linux notes

- **AppImage:** needs FUSE. Without it: `./Myko_*.AppImage --appimage-extract-and-run`. On Wayland with rendering glitches, try `WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1`. Otherwise the `.deb` / `.rpm` packages link against the system GTK stack and tend to be smoother.

## Configure AI

1. Open **Settings -> AI**.
2. Pick a provider and paste your API key. For local inference, point Myko at your LM Studio / MLX / Ollama endpoint.
3. Keys are written to the OS keychain via `keyring`. They never touch disk or localStorage.

## Build from source

**Prerequisites**
- Rust (stable), https://rustup.rs
- Node 20+ and pnpm
- Tauri prerequisites for your platform, https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/

**Run**
```bash
pnpm install
pnpm tauri dev        # development
pnpm tauri build      # production bundle
```

**Checks**
```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm check-types
pnpm test
cd src-tauri && cargo clippy --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings   # Rust lint
cd src-tauri && cargo nextest run --locked                           # or: cargo test --locked
```
